CIS565: Project 2: CUDA Pathtracer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fall 2012
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due Friday, 10/12/2012
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implemented Features:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Full global illumination (including soft shadows, color bleeding, etc.) by pathtracing rays through the scene. 
* Properly accumulating emittance and colors to generate a final image
* Supersampled antialiasing
* Parallelization by ray instead of by pixel via string compaction (see the Physically-based shading and pathtracing lecture slides from 09/24 if you don't know what this refers to)
* Perfect specular reflection

* Depth of field
* Refraction( still working on it)

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this project, you are given code for:

* All of the basecode from Project 1, plus:
* Intersection testing code for spheres and cubes
* Code for raycasting from the camera

You will need to implement the following features. A number of these required features you may have already implemented in Project 1. If you have, you are ahead of the curve and have less work to do! 

* Full global illumination (including soft shadows, color bleeding, etc.) by pathtracing rays through the scene. 
* Properly accumulating emittance and colors to generate a final image
* Supersampled antialiasing
* Parallelization by ray instead of by pixel via string compaction (see the Physically-based shading and pathtracing lecture slides from 09/24 if you don't know what this refers to)
* Perfect specular reflection

You are also required to implement at least two of the following features. Some of these features you may have already implemented in Project 1. If you have, you may NOT resubmit those features and instead must pick two new ones to implement.

* Additional BRDF models, such as Cook-Torrance, Ward, etc. Each BRDF model may count as a separate feature. 
* Texture mapping 
* Bump mapping
* Translational motion blur
* Fresnel-based Refraction, i.e. glass
* OBJ Mesh loading and rendering without KD-Tree
* Interactive camera
* Integrate an existing stackless KD-Tree library, such as CUKD (https://github.com/unvirtual/cukd)
* Depth of field

Alternatively, implementing just one of the following features can satisfy the "pick two" feature requirement, since these are correspondingly more difficult problems:

* Physically based subsurface scattering and transmission
* Implement and integrate your own stackless KD-Tree from scratch. 
* Displacement mapping
* Deformational motion blur

As yet another alternative, if you have a feature or features you really want to implement that are not on this list, let us know, and we'll probably say yes!
