Implemented the following:

* Depth of field with aperture control (Make the aperture value in the scene files greater than 25 to have pin hole effect)
* Mesh (obj) loader
* Full reflection and refraction using Fresnel equations
* Tried some hard coded motion blur, but didn't get time do it using the frame values
* Coded up the Cook Torrance BRDF, but did not get time to tweak it
