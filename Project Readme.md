CUDA PATHTRACER


FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

- I could not complete the whole assignment. I have implemented the required features but no extra features.

-There is some problem while using stream compaction. The program crashes. But just after a crash, it runs for the next time. Still haven't figured out the problem.

- On having transparent surfaces, they appear black. But caustics appear. Don't know the problem again.

- I have used thrust for stream compaction

- I have used russian roulette for reflective surfaces to hae a combination of diffuse and reflection.


SCREENSHOTS:

- Screenshots of the renders are in the 'renders' directory.
